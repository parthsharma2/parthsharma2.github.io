      <description>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 3rd June 2019 Summary:
 Refactor metric implementations to accept repo_group_id and repo_id instead of repo_url to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme. Add API endpoints for the metric implementations. Write documentation. Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</description>
