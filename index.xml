      <description>This week, I spent most of the time studying Augur&amp;rsquo;s worker architecture (broker &amp;amp; housekeeper) and refactoring the github repository metadata worker to integrate into Augur&amp;rsquo;s architecture.
Meeting Summary Date: NA
No meeting was held this week.
Work Done This Week  GitHub Repository Metadata Worker:  Refactored the worker to work with the broker, i.e. allow the broker to send tasks to the worker. This allows you to manually send tasks to the worker.</description>

      <description>This week officially marked the end of Coding Phase 1 and the first evaluation period (which I succesfully passed ðŸŽ‰). Also, Augur&amp;rsquo;s new UI (which is pretty cool) was merged into the dev branch (it&amp;rsquo;s not fully functional yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s a big moment for Augur). The old stable version of Augur can be currently found in the stable-demo branch.

      <description>This week I implemented evolution &amp;amp; risk metrics.

No meeting was held this week.
Work Done This Week The following metrics were implemented:
 Evolution  Issue Duration: returns the duration of all closed issues. Issues Active: returns a timeseries of the number of issues active per period(day, week, month, year). In this implementation, an issue is considered active if a GitHub issue event occurs.  Risk  CII Best Practices Badge: returns the CII Best Practices Badge level.</description>

      <description>This week involved quite a bit of writing unit tests &amp;amp; documentation. It also involved reading and understanding a lot of Javascript for a better understanding of Augur&amp;rsquo;s frontend.
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 10th June 2019  Develop unit tests for metric implementations &amp;amp; API endpoints. Write documentation for &amp;lsquo;Create a metric&amp;rsquo;. Start looking at developing the frontend for the metric implementations. Make changes to the frontend to be able to work with Augur&amp;rsquo;s new architecture &amp;amp; API endpoint scheme.</description>
