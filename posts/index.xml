			<description>This week officially marked the end of Coding Phase 1 and the first evaluation period (which I succesfully passed ðŸŽ‰). Also, Augur&amp;rsquo;s new UI (which is pretty cool) was merged into the dev branch (it&amp;rsquo;s not fully functional yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s a big moment for Augur). The old stable version of Augur can be currently found in the stable-demo branch.

After quite a bit of googling &amp; searching for answers on StackOverflow I was able to implement the <em>issue throughput</em> metric.</li>

			<description>This week I implemented evolution &amp;amp; risk metrics.
Meeting Summary Date: NA
No meeting was held this week.
Work Done This Week The following metrics were implemented:
 Evolution  Issue Duration: returns the duration of all closed issues. Issues Active: returns a timeseries of the number of issues active per period(day, week, month, year). In this implementation, an issue is considered active if a GitHub issue event occurs.  Risk  CII Best Practices Badge: returns the CII Best Practices Badge level.</description>

<ul>
<li>Exploring Augur&rsquo;s frontend was quite a challenge this week due to my lack of experience in Javascript &amp; Vue.js. With help from everyone working on Augur, I was able to get a nice high-level overview of how the frontend works. I&rsquo;m still working on getting a better understanding of Augur&rsquo;s frontend &amp; trying to get the metric implementations on to the frontend.</li>

			<description>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 3rd June 2019 Summary:
 Refactor metric implementations to accept repo_group_id and repo_id instead of repo_url to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme. Add API endpoints for the metric implementations. Write documentation. Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</description>

<p>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-summary">Meeting Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, 3rd June 2019 </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor metric implementations to accept <code>repo_group_id</code> and <code>repo_id</code> instead of <code>repo_url</code> to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme.</li>
<li>Add API endpoints for the metric implementations.</li>
<li>Write documentation.</li>
<li>Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work-done-this-week">Work Done This Week</h2>

<ul>
<li>All metrics implemented last week were refactored to work on repo groups as well as repos. Which means now you can use a metric on a specific repository using the <code>/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/repos/:repo_id/[metric]</code> endpoint, or on a group of repositories in one go using <code>/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/[metric]</code> endpoint.</li>
<li>Created API endpoints for the refactored metric implementations.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/291/commits/94c99097e2b1e6ed2c8f51f981c7e236a5304d1e">helper functions</a> that simplify creating API endpoints [This was fun. Learnt quite a bit about routing in Flask and the Python Data Model ðŸ˜„].</li>
<li>Documented the new API endpoints.</li>
