			<description>This week involved quite a bit of writing unit tests &amp;amp; documentation. It also involved reading and understanding a lot of Javascript for a better understanding of Augur&amp;rsquo;s frontend.
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 10th June 2019  Develop unit tests for metric implementations &amp;amp; API endpoints. Write documentation for &amp;lsquo;Create a metric&amp;rsquo;. Start looking at developing the frontend for the metric implementations. Make changes to the frontend to be able to work with Augur&amp;rsquo;s new architecture &amp;amp; API endpoint scheme.</description>

<h2 id="challenges-encountered">Challenges Encountered</h2>

<ul>
<li>Exploring Augur&rsquo;s frontend was quite a challenge this week due to my lack of experience in Javascript &amp; Vue.js. With help from everyone working on Augur, I was able to get a nice high-level overview of how the frontend works. I&rsquo;m still working on getting a better understanding of Augur&rsquo;s frontend &amp; trying to get the metric implementations on to the frontend.</li>
</ul>

<li>Get a better understanding of Augur&rsquo;s frontend.</li>
<li>Start developing the frontend for the metric implementations.</li>
<li>More future plans for next week to be decided in the <em>next meeting</em> on <strong>Monday, 17th June 2019</strong>.</li>

			<description>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 3rd June 2019 Summary:
 Refactor metric implementations to accept repo_group_id and repo_id instead of repo_url to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme. Add API endpoints for the metric implementations. Write documentation. Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</description>

<p>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-summary">Meeting Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, 3rd June 2019 </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor metric implementations to accept <code>repo_group_id</code> and <code>repo_id</code> instead of <code>repo_url</code> to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme.</li>
<li>Add API endpoints for the metric implementations.</li>
<li>Write documentation.</li>
<li>Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work-done-this-week">Work Done This Week</h2>

<ul>
<li>All metrics implemented last week were refactored to work on repo groups as well as repos. Which means now you can use a metric on a specific repository using the <code>/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/repos/:repo_id/[metric]</code> endpoint, or on a group of repositories in one go using <code>/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/[metric]</code> endpoint.</li>
<li>Created API endpoints for the refactored metric implementations.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/291/commits/94c99097e2b1e6ed2c8f51f981c7e236a5304d1e">helper functions</a> that simplify creating API endpoints [This was fun. Learnt quite a bit about routing in Flask and the Python Data Model ðŸ˜„].</li>
<li>Documented the new API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
