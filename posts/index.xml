			<description>This week, I spent most of my time debugging the Pull Request worker.
Meeting Summary Date: NA
No meeting was held this week.
Work Done This Week  GitHub Repository Metadata Worker:
 Improved logging. The log file now includes the worker&amp;rsquo;s name and also logs exception tracebacks that help in debugging. Error Handling. The worker doesn&amp;rsquo;t quit when it encounters an error while performing a task. It logs the error and moves onto the next task.</description>

</ul>

<h2 id="challenges-encountered">Challenges Encountered</h2>

<p>Fixing the bug that caused a &lsquo;Unique Key Violation&rsquo; in the DB when inserting Pull Request comments was the most challenging task. I spent hours going through the PR worker&rsquo;s code and testing it on various repositories just to realize that the error wasn&rsquo;t in the code but the database.</p>

<p>The previous version of the PR worker used to manually set the primary key of each record inserted in the DB. This messed up the DB&rsquo;s primary key counter. The latest version of the PR worker relies on the DB to autoincrement the primary key each time a new record is inserted. So, each time the PR worker tries to insert a comment, the autoincremented primary key already exists in the DB thus resulting in a &lsquo;Unique Key Violation&rsquo; error.</p>

<p>The fix was pretty simple. All we needed to do was to set the DB&rsquo;s primary key counter for the comments table to the max primary key in the comments table.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Continue working on the Pull Request Worker.</li>

			<description>This week officialy marked the end of the second coding phase. Most of my work this week involved working on the Pull Request Worker
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 22nd July 2019
 @sgoggins cleared a few doubts I had regarding the Pull Request Worker Discussed creating new API endpoints that allow a user to add Repo-Groups and Repos to Augur. For example a POST request on repo-groups/ creates a Repo-Group &amp;amp; a POST request on repos/ adds a repository and begins the data collection process.</description>

			<description>This week, I created a worker that fetches a repository&amp;rsquo;s information (forks, stargazers, watchers, etc.) and implemented a few metrics based on the repository&amp;rsquo;s information.
Meeting Summary Date: NA
No meeting was held this week.
Work Done This Week  Metrics Implemented:
 Forks: Returns a time series of fork count. Fork Count: Returns the latest fork count. Stars: Returns a time series of stargazers count. Stars Count: Returns the latest stargazers count.</description>

			<description>This week officially marked the end of Coding Phase 1 and the first evaluation period (which I succesfully passed 🎉). Also, Augur&amp;rsquo;s new UI (which is pretty cool) was merged into the dev branch (it&amp;rsquo;s not fully functional yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s a big moment for Augur). The old stable version of Augur can be currently found in the stable-demo branch.

<h2 id="challenges-encountered">Challenges Encountered</h2>

<ul>
<li>Exploring Augur&rsquo;s frontend was quite a challenge this week due to my lack of experience in Javascript &amp; Vue.js. With help from everyone working on Augur, I was able to get a nice high-level overview of how the frontend works. I&rsquo;m still working on getting a better understanding of Augur&rsquo;s frontend &amp; trying to get the metric implementations on to the frontend.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get a better understanding of Augur&rsquo;s frontend.</li>
<li>Start developing the frontend for the metric implementations.</li>
<li>More future plans for next week to be decided in the <em>next meeting</em> on <strong>Monday, 17th June 2019</strong>.</li>

			<description>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 3rd June 2019 Summary:
 Refactor metric implementations to accept repo_group_id and repo_id instead of repo_url to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme. Add API endpoints for the metric implementations. Write documentation. Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</description>

<p>This week involved quite a bit of refactoring and getting the refactored metric implementation functions linked to API endpoints. Also, I got to play around with python functions.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-summary">Meeting Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, 3rd June 2019 </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor metric implementations to accept <code>repo_group_id</code> and <code>repo_id</code> instead of <code>repo_url</code> to adhere to the new API endpoint scheme.</li>
<li>Add API endpoints for the metric implementations.</li>
<li>Write documentation.</li>
<li>Create unit tests for the metric implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work-done-this-week">Work Done This Week</h2>

<ul>
<li>All metrics implemented last week were refactored to work on repo groups as well as repos. Which means now you can use a metric on a specific repository using the <code>/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/repos/:repo_id/[metric]</code> endpoint, or on a group of repositories in one go using <code>/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/[metric]</code> endpoint.</li>
<li>Created API endpoints for the refactored metric implementations.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/291/commits/94c99097e2b1e6ed2c8f51f981c7e236a5304d1e">helper functions</a> that simplify creating API endpoints [This was fun. Learnt quite a bit about routing in Flask and the Python Data Model 😄].</li>
<li>Documented the new API endpoints.</li>
