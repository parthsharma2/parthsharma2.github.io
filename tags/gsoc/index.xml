      <description>This week officialy marked the end of the second coding phase. Most of my work this week involved working on the Pull Request Worker
Meeting Summary Date: Monday, 22nd July 2019
 @sgoggins cleared a few doubts I had regarding the Pull Request Worker Discussed creating new API endpoints that allow a user to add Repo-Groups and Repos to Augur. For example a POST request on repo-groups/ creates a Repo-Group &amp;amp; a POST request on repos/ adds a repository and begins the data collection process.</description>

      <description>This week, I spent most of the time studying Augur&amp;rsquo;s worker architecture (broker &amp;amp; housekeeper) and refactoring the github repository metadata worker to integrate into Augur&amp;rsquo;s architecture.
Meeting Summary Date: NA
No meeting was held this week.
Work Done This Week  GitHub Repository Metadata Worker:  Refactored the worker to work with the broker, i.e. allow the broker to send tasks to the worker. This allows you to manually send tasks to the worker.</description>

      <description>This week officially marked the end of Coding Phase 1 and the first evaluation period (which I succesfully passed ðŸŽ‰). Also, Augur&amp;rsquo;s new UI (which is pretty cool) was merged into the dev branch (it&amp;rsquo;s not fully functional yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s a big moment for Augur). The old stable version of Augur can be currently found in the stable-demo branch.
